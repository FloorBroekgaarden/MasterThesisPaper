% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We find that importance sampling methods can significantly enhance stellar evolution simulations. Binary population synthesis models are a versatile tool in astrophysics to simulate the evolution of populations of stars and compare theory and observations.  They include a large variety of underlying binary interaction processes that are challenging to model and induce uncertainties in the outcome of the model. Hence, to fully understand the simulations outcome and subsequently the underlying physics, it is important to incorporate uncertainty from the beginning of the model instead of as an afterthought, to reduce its computational cost. Especially when simulating rare events such as gravitational waves.  We find that importance sampling methods can reduce the costs of the simulation up to a factor $\sim 100$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
Rapid binary population synthesis models are a versatile tool in astrophysics to simulate the evolution of populations of stars and compare theory and observations. Examples are for example binary$\_$c, Startreck, SEBA and COMPAS. These models interpolate the physics fro more detailed models, and can therefore present a rapid simulation that can handle the evaluation of many stars, i.e. a population. Nevertheless, due to the multiscale simulations and comlex physics involving many parameters, it becomes computational expensive to simulate a large variety of poulations, which therefore limits our exploration of the parameter space and understanding of our model outcome. Especially considering ever growing complexity in the model. Hence it is important to reduce the costs of the simulation, especially for the next generation population synthesis models. 
(and  based on more detailed  They are based on and interpolate Hurley etc. )
%
Especially rare events (GWs are rare events) 







All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by \citet{Others2013},
and describes the problem the authors aim to solve \citep[e.g.][]{Author2012}.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{COMPAS}

\subsection{adaptive Importance Sampling}

%It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.

\subsection{Maths}
\label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
	\label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.

% Example figure
\begin{figure}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
\end{figure}

% Example table
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
	\label{tab:example_table}
	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
		\hline
		A & B & C & D\\
		\hline
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\section{Results}

\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

The Acknowledgements section is not numbered. Here you can thank helpful
colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
Try to keep it short.
